Spotify Clone Project
Welcome to my Spotify Clone project! ðŸŽ¶ This project is a recreation of the Spotify interface using HTML and CSS.

Project Overview:
I took up the challenge to replicate the iconic Spotify design with the simplicity of HTML for structure and the styling magic of CSS. 
The project aims to showcase a responsive and user-friendly playlist display.

Tech Stack:
HTML: Used for structuring the content and creating the backbone of the clone.
CSS: Employed extensively for styling, including color schemes, fonts, and layout.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: Ensured the clone looks great on various devices.
Stylish UI: Tried to capture the essence of Spotify's sleek design.
Playlist Display: Implemented a clean and organized layout similar to the original.

How to View the Project:
Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/anuradha-022/Spotify-Clone.git]
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Challenges Faced:
Recreating Spotify's dynamic features without JavaScript posed some interesting challenges. However, it was a valuable learning experience.

Future Improvements:
Considering adding JavaScript to introduce interactivity and potentially integrate basic music playback functionality.
